/*
 * This is a clean, fast, modern and free Perlin Simplex noise function.
 * It is a stand-alone compilation unit with no external dependencies,
 * highly reusable without source code modifications.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * Replacing the "double" type with "double" can actually make this run faster
 * on some platforms. Having both versions could be useful.
